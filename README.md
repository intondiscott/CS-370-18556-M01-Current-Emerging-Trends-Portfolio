<h1>CS-370 Reflection</h1>
<p>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</p>
<ul>
    <li>For this project, I worked on developing an intelligent agent to navigate a treasure hunt game as a pirate, using a deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm. The goal was to create an agent capable of pathfinding to find the treasure before the human player, which involved training the agent to make decisions based on its environment.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The provided starter code consisted of a basic structure of the game environment, including the map layout, obstacles, and pathways. It also contained the initial framework for the pirate agent but did not include the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm. The code provided basic functionality, such as the game's setup and environment definitions.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I implemented the Q-learning algorithm to enable the pirate agent to learn the optimal path to the treasure. The deep Q-learning approach uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, which stores the expected future rewards for state-action pairs. </li>
</ul>
<p>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer scientists solve problems by designing algorithms, software, and systems. They create technologies that impact many fields, such as AI, machine learning, and game development. In this project, I applied computer science to a pathfinding problem, which is fundamental in AI. The work of computer scientists improves efficiency, creates new capabilities, and enhances user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</p>
<ul>
    <li>I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller tasks. In this project, I first understood the pathfinding problem, then designed and implemented a Q-learning solution, and tested it to refine the agentâ€™s performance. The process involves defining the problem, designing a solution, implementing it, and testing for improvement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</p>
<ul>
    <li>My ethical responsibilities include ensuring fairness, transparency, and security. The agent should offer a fair challenge to players, respect user privacy, and provide clear explanations of its behavior. Additionally, I must ensure the game works reliably and continue improving it based on feedback, all while maintaining ethical standards for user data and experience.
